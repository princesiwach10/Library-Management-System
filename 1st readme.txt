In this assignment I have created a library management system

A Superuser i.e., Admin can perform All CURD Operations on Books.
- Create a superuser by console. (python manage.py createsuperuser)

A Student, which have group of "User" can only view books.
- Student can signup through website.

Permission for all students have been set by Django Groups Permission which is "User".

I also attached DB file that you can check.
